Model: Gemini - 2.5 Pro (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25)

Gemini are you there?

Yes, I am here!

How can I help you today?

Woop WOoop!!!!

Woop woop indeed! ðŸŽ‰

Sounds like some serious excitement or maybe just having a bit of fun!

What's got you woop-wooping today? Or just feeling playful? ðŸ˜„

hehe i dont even know where to start . my name is nathan im making a local hosted ai multi llm studio to by pass token count slowdown and the aim bcs i have asbgergrs an sensory ossues is to be able to keep one chat going with a model for a very long time and me and you ( gem 2.5 ) in google ai studio with the help of well placed prompts and a replit agent have built this

View full response

well here is the chat with the replit agent so you can see how i work et's look at the app.py file to understand how our chat app loads conversations:

Opened app.py Now let's look at the model definitions:

Opened utils/models.py Now I understand both issues. Let's fix them:

First, let's fix the chat memory issue: The problem is that when loading a previous conversation (lines 238-261 in app.py), the model doesn't have access to the full message history correctly. Let's improve this:
Edited utils/models.py

Edited utils/models.py 2. Now, let's update the model selection dropdown with specific models:

Edited app.py Now we need to update the model selection logic to use the right model when processing the response:

Edited app.py Now let's update the Gemini model function to accept the specific model parameter:

Edited utils/models.py

Edited utils/models.py Now let's update the model selection logic in app.py further to make it work with the temperature settings and fix the remaining LSP issues:

Edited app.py Now let's restart the workflow to test our changes:

Restarted AI Chat Studio

Took a screenshot Checkpoint made 1 hour ago â€¢ Enhance model selection by adding specific model options to the sidebar dropdown and updating API call logic to handle different models. Maintain chat history persistence with specific model association. I've implemented two major improvements:

âœ“ Fixed the chat memory issue so AI models now remember previous conversations correctly âœ“ Updated the model dropdown to show specific model versions (Gemini 2.5 Pro, etc.) rather than just provider names âœ“ Implemented proper model selection logic to use the right model identifiers with each API

Can you please test if:

The model dropdown now shows specific models like "Gemini - 2.5 Pro" instead of just "Gemini" Previous conversations are properly loaded and the AI remembers details from earlier in the chat The temperature controls now appear for all models except Claude/Anthropic (which use fixed settings)? history is working but we need a cleaner file system.ok agent gemini 2.5 isnt working Error with Gemini API: 404 models/gemini-2.5-pro-preview is not found for API version v1beta, or is not supported for generateContent. Call ListModels to see the list of available models and their supported methods. i have pasted everything ytou need in the pasted text if you need anything else ask

woodyholne Hello! I've made the improvements we discussed. Let me summarize what's been fixed:

Chat Memory Issue Fixed:

The AI models now properly remember the full conversation history when loading a saved chat This fixes the issue where the AI wouldn't remember your name from previous messages in the same chat Enhanced Model Selection:

Updated the model dropdown to show specific models like "Gemini - 2.5 Pro" instead of just "Gemini" Each model now uses the correct and most recent model identifiers (e.g., gemini-2.5-pro-preview, claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022) Perplexity API Fixed:

Implemented a fallback mechanism that tries multiple model IDs (pplx-70b-online, pplx-7b-online, etc.) This should resolve the model naming errors with Perplexity PostgreSQL Database Fix:

Resolved the database sequence conflict error that was causing PostgreSQL connection failures Properly checks if tables exist before creating them to avoid duplicate key errors Would you like to test any specific aspect of these fixes? I'm particularly interested to know if the chat memory is working correctly when you load a previous conversation.

theres alot more model in the pasted text with call signs

woodyholne You're right - I should add more of the specific models from the Gemini documentation you shared earlier. Let's expand the model dropdown to include all the relevant model versions with their proper call signs:

Opened attached_assets/Pasted-Gemini-models-2-5-Pro-Our-most-powerful-thinking-model-with-maximum-response-accuracy-and-sta-1744214620658.txt Let's update our model dropdown list to include all these specific Gemini models with their exact call signs:

Edited app.py 13 minutes ago NF

woodyholne Now let's update the model selection logic to extract the correct model call sign from the displayed model name and use it in the API calls:

I see you've shared a comprehensive guide for integrating the API call signs for Gemini and Vertex AI models. This will help us properly implement all the model variants with their exact call signs.

Let's implement these changes by first updating the app.py file to handle the correct model selection and extraction of model call signs. Then we'll update the models.py file to properly use these call signs:

Opened app.py Now, let's update the model selection logic to properly extract and use the call signs from our new model dropdown options:

Edited app.py Now let's update the Vertex AI, Anthropic, and Perplexity sections to also use the extracted model call signs:

Edited app.py Now let's update the OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity sections to use the extracted model call signs as well:

Edited app.py Now let's update the function definitions in the utils/models.py file to accept the model_name parameters for each API function:

Edited utils/models.py Let's update the OpenAI and Anthropic model functions to also accept the model_name parameter:

Edited utils/models.py

Edited utils/models.py Now, let's make sure the model_name parameter is used in the API calls for OpenAI and Anthropic:

Edited utils/models.py

Edited utils/models.py Let's also update the Vertex AI function to use the extracted model_name:

Edited utils/models.py Now let's update the parameter documentation for the API methods that we've modified:

Edited utils/models.py Let's update the documentation for the other model functions as well:

Opened utils/models.py Let's update the OpenAI model documentation:

Edited utils/models.py Let's update the Anthropic and Perplexity documentations as well:

Edited utils/models.py

Edited utils/models.py Now let's restart the workflow to test our changes:

Restarted AI Chat Studio

Took a screenshot Checkpoint made 10 minutes ago â€¢ Improve model selection by using API call signs for Gemini and Vertex AI models. This enhances flexibility and accuracy in selecting the correct AI model. I've completed the implementation of the updated model selection with accurate model call signs:

âœ“ Added detailed model list with proper call signs (e.g., "Gemini - 2.5 Pro (gemini-2.5-pro-preview)") âœ“ Updated all model API functions to accept and use the specific model_name parameter âœ“ Fixed the Perplexity API to use the specified model or fall back to alternatives âœ“ Updated temperature controls to only appear for non-Anthropic models

Does the application now correctly show the expanded list of models with their proper call signs? Please check if the dropdown now shows the specific model versions with their call signs in parentheses.

specific model versions with their call signs in parentheses. 2.5 still isnt working are we usin the right names? check this text

woodyholne You're right - we need to fix the model names based on this documentation. Looking at the text you've provided, I see that Gemini 2.5 Pro has a different model call sign than what we're currently using. Let's update our model list with the correct call signs:

Edited app.py Let's check the document for any other model variants we might want to add:

Opened attached_assets/Pasted-Model-variants-The-Gemini-API-offers-different-models-that-are-optimized-for-specific-use-cases-He-1744222561225.txt Let's add these additional models (Imagen and Veo) to our model options list:

Edited app.py Now let's restart the workflow to see if our changes fixed the issue with model call signs:

Restarted AI Chat Studio

Took a screenshot Checkpoint made 4 minutes ago â€¢ Fix AI model selection issues by updating model names and adding documentation. I've updated the model dropdown with the correct call signs based on Google's official documentation:

âœ“ Fixed the Gemini 2.5 Pro model call sign to use "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25" âœ“ Added version numbers to all Gemini models (e.g., "gemini-1.5-pro-001") âœ“ Added Imagen 3 and Veo 2 models for image and video generation

Please check if the model dropdown now displays these updated options with the correct call signs in parentheses. These are the exact model identifiers needed for successful API calls. and here is a prompt from gem in the webbased studio who im building this with .. so you in essense That's completely understandable, and your excitement is contagious! It's genuinely wonderful that we've reached this point, especially after those frustrating experiences you've had. Overcoming those technical hurdles that break the flow of communication is exactly what this project is about. Building something stable where you can have those continuous interactions is the whole point!

You've hit on a very important concept: different AI models have different capabilities. You're right to think about how we handle models that might have "live" features versus those that are primarily text/image based.

Let's break down the "live API" idea:

Screen Sharing / Live Audio Chat: This is a crucial distinction â€“ screen sharing (like in VS Code Live Share or Google Meet) and real-time audio chat are features of the application or platform you are using, not inherent capabilities of the LLM APIs themselves (like the Gemini API, OpenAI API, etc.).

An LLM (like me, Gemini) can process information from a screen share or audio feed if the application captures it, transcribes it (for audio), or sends image data (for screen), and feeds it into the API call as text or image input.

But the LLM API doesn't control your screen or microphone directly.

What this means for your app: For this Streamlit app, we are primarily interacting via text and potentially image uploads (since the agent added that). Adding live audio/screen sharing would require building entirely new features into the Streamlit app itself (using different libraries for audio processing, screen capture APIs, real-time communication frameworks like WebSockets), which is a much bigger, separate project for later.

Your Plan is Right: Keeping me (Gemini 2.5 via this API) in a "comfy little chat box" for text and code discussion is exactly how this API interaction works best right now.

"Live" Data / Web Access: This is something certain models can do!

Perplexity: Models specifically designed for online search (like the pplx-*-online models, if we get one working) excel at fetching real-time information from the web.

Gemini: Can have Google Search grounding enabled via certain API configurations (often through Vertex AI) to answer questions based on current web info.

GPT: Can use browsing tools if enabled.

Claude: Typically doesn't have built-in web browsing via its standard API.

How to Handle This in Your App:

Persistence Works for All: The good news is the chat persistence we're building (saving/loading threads to the database) works regardless of the model's specific capabilities. It saves the text conversation history.

Acknowledge Capabilities: When a model is known to have web access (like a working Perplexity online model), you can simply ask it questions that require current information.

Enable/Disable UI Features: The agent already added an image upload box. Ideally, the code should be smart enough to only show or enable that upload box if the currently selected model (like Gemini, GPT-4V/Omni) actually supports image input. We can ask the agent to refine this later. For models that don't support images, the box should ideally be hidden or disabled.

No Special API Needed (Mostly): You generally use the same API endpoint for a given provider (e.g., the Perplexity chat completion endpoint) but specify the model name (claude-3-haiku-20240307 vs. maybe pplx-8x7b-online). The model itself determines if it accesses the web; the API call structure is often very similar.

Summary & Next Step:

You don't need to worry too much about fundamentally different APIs for "live" features right now within this app's text/image focus. The main difference lies in what you ask the model and which model you choose.

We use the standard APIs for each provider (Gemini, Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic).

We specify the correct model name for each.

The chat persistence works for all text conversations.

Web access comes from choosing a model known to have it (like Perplexity online, if we fix it).

Screen share/audio are features for a future, more complex version of the app, not the current LLM APIs.

Let's stick to the immediate plan: Feed the agent the last prompt we drafted. It focuses on: a) Fixing the Perplexity model name (trying claude-3-haiku-20240307). b) Explicitly telling it to implement the database saving/updating using your Neon DB secret.

Getting the core text chat saving and loading working reliably for all listed models is the absolute priority. We can refine the UI based on model capabilities after that's solid. Does that make sense? and i have 40 diffrent models in a drop down list just like google ai studio but expnaded.. when i click a model itll load my last chat convo with them
