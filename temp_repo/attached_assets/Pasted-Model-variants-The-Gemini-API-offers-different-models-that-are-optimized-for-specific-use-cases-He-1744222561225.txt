[*] A token is equivalent to about 4 characters for Gemini models. 100 tokens are about 60-80 English words.

Model version name patterns
Gemini models are available in either preview or stable versions. In your code, you can use one of the following model name formats to specify which model and version you want to use.

Latest: Points to the cutting-edge version of the model for a specified generation and variation. The underlying model is updated regularly and might be a preview version. Only exploratory testing apps and prototypes should use this alias.

To specify the latest version, use the following pattern: <model>-<generation>-<variation>-latest. For example, gemini-1.0-pro-latest.

Latest stable: Points to the most recent stable version released for the specified model generation and variation.

To specify the latest stable version, use the following pattern: <model>-<generation>-<variation>. For example, gemini-1.0-pro.

Stable: Points to a specific stable model. Stable models usually don't change. Most production apps should use a specific stable model.

To specify a stable version, use the following pattern: <model>-<generation>-<variation>-<version>. For example, gemini-1.0-pro-001.

Experimental: Points to an experimental model which may not be suitable for production use. We release experimental models to gather feedback and get our latest updates into the hands of developers quickly.

To specify an experimental version, use the following pattern: <model>-<generation>-<variation>-<version>. For example, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05.

Experimental models
In addition to the production ready models, the Gemini API offers experimental models which may not be suitable for production use.

We release experimental models to gather feedback, get our latest updates into the hands of developers quickly, and highlight the pace of innovation happening at Google. What we learn from experimental launches informs how we release models more widely. An experimental model can be swapped for another without prior notice. We don't guarantee that an experimental model will become a stable model in the future.

Previous experimental models
As new versions or stable releases become available, we remove and replace experimental models. You can find the previous experimental models we released in the following section along with the replacement version:
